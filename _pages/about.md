## About me

I am a PhD candidate at New York University working on human-in-the-loop driving simulation and safety-critical construction-site scenarios.

My research focuses on building VR-based dual-user simulation systems on top of CARLA and Unreal Engine to study realistic driver–worker interactions that are difficult and risky to observe in the real world. I integrate multimodal sensing, including driver gaze, biometric signals, and vehicle telemetry, to analyze human behavior and attention under complex traffic conditions.

I also leverage the collected data to develop and evaluate human-like autonomous driving models using imitation learning and vision–language–action approaches.

I am currently seeking research internship opportunities related to autonomous driving, robotics, computer vision, and human-centered AI.
