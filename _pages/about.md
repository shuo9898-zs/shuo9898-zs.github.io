## About me

I am a third-year PhD candidate at New York University conducting research on driving simulation, traffic safety, and autonomous driving.


My research centers on traffic safety in complex and hazardous roadway scenarios, with a particular focus on construction sites. I design and build HCI-driven, VR-based dual-user simulation platforms on top of CARLA and Unreal Engine to safely study driver–worker interactions that are difficult or risky to observe in the real world.

Through these platforms, I collect and analyze multimodal human data, including driver gaze, biometric signals, and vehicle sensor data, to investigate human factors such as attention, workload, and behavioral responses under complex traffic conditions.

Building on the collected human data, I further explore imitation learning–based approaches to develop and evaluate human-like autonomous driving policies, including vision–language–action models, with the goal of improving autonomous vehicle behavior in safety-critical environments.

I am currently seeking research internship opportunities related to autonomous driving, human-centered AI, robotics, and computer vision.
